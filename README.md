# Smart-Classroom

This a model smart classroom. The classroom featueres a smart attendance system along with an efficient electricity conservation system. As soon as the first student enters the classroom, all the lights off the class will turn on and as soon as the last student exits the classroom, all the lights will turn off. this is done using two cameras mounted on either side of the door frame. The camera also marks the attendance. Controlling lights is done using arduino.
